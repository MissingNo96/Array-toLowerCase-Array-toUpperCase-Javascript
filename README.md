# Array toLowerCase and Array toUpperCase in Javascript

A simple function to content all the elements of an array to lowercase/uppercase.

I mean two functions lol.

NOTE: I won't say this is the best way to do the stuff, but I didn't find any other code that does this work on Github, so this code will work for now
